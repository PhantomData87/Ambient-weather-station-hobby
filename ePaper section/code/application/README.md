# Purpose
This is the main function that will render & display the screen. It uses my own custom library to render this & finally is made with the consideration of being both practical and small in overall size (including memory usage). The "values" that appear on it were meant to test the screen's full ability and thus a lot of pseudocode exist within this file.  
  
Below are images of what will be displayed when succesfully ran.  
  
# Isn't the same as the main file?
Yes, mostly. This is a template where the main file will be derived from.
