# What is this?
I needed a simple device that could tell me the temperature & dust density in a local space. I could have bought something in amazon for instance just to get that need out of the way. Until I thought about it; What if I make one? After some pondering, I knew I lacked the skills to make one, but yet it seemed so much more intriguing than learnning precise math (The one that requires perfect grammer). So here we are. This is a project that went from a need, needed to re-learn fundementals of electrical engineering, learn the basics of IoT development, and learn to interface with hardware.  

### Why categorize everything in files?
They are to give more insight in the progress I had been making  

### This seems rather messy to navigate through
Don't worry, once this is all over. I plan on making a simple pdf about everything I had used, discovered, read, and tried with this project. Of course this will be last since documenting takes away time that could be spent on perfecting something else.  

# Progress
Finished rough idea  
Finished rediscovering electronic components  
Finished obtaining equipment for electrical appliances  
Finished obtaining pieces for building device  
Finished "electrical" wiring on software  
Half way finished testing physical components  
Half way finished coding software/drivers for physical components  
Need physical sketch of product  
Need materials for hardening product  
Need to finish final prototype  

# Delay
Currently, I know I should be more miles ahead of where I am if I compare myself to past projects. It's been quite the struggle to handle a unknown trigger that causes me to feel the intense need to sleep. As I learn to live with that, progress is various things have slown down (some to a crawl). I hope to now finish this before May 2024.
