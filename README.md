# Ambient-weather-station-hobby
This is my attempt in learning how to handle IoT development and learn making custom physical tools. Tools that involved a bit more hands on. Here I will document any progress I had made. However, this is more of a hobby and thus will oly be acted upon whenever I have the time. Original project start date; Oct 15th 2023
